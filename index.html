<h1>My Hobby: Hypnosis</h1>

<p>
One of my hobbies is a little unusual. I'm a hypnotist. I've been hypnotizing
people for about 10 years now. In the past, I ran an educational blog and
had a store where you could buy recordings at <a href="www.ihypnou.com">www.ihypnou.com</a>,
but it's currently dead due to a broken wordpress install. :( I still have
some videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/iHypnoU">YouTube</a> and at
least one article on <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-Hypnosis-Induction/">Instructables</a>.

	<h4>The Stroop Effect</h4>
<p>
Quite a few people are skeptical about hypnosis. When you see someone hypnotized in
a video or at a live show, it's hard to tell whether they're really 'under' or
just going along with it. Because there's no great definition of what hypnosis
is, some people question whether or not it even exists. But there are some
experiments that make it quite obvious that <em>something</em> is going on.
</p>
<p>
One of my favorite demonstrations with hypnosis has to do with something called
the Stroop Effect.  It's based on a chart like the one shown below:
</p>
<img src="stroopa.gif" alt="Color names written in their color">
<p>
You time how long it takes someone to list out the colors that the words are
written in.  Then you compare just how long it takes to do the same thing with
the image below.
</p>
<img src="stroopb.gif" alt="Color names written in other colors">
<p>
The second image, where the color names are written in completely different
colors, takes people substantially longer to complete, due to the brain
wanting to return the color word as the answer.
</p>

<p>
However, if you hypnotize
someone and give them the suggestion that the words in the image are gibberish
and unreadable, the difference in time
disappears. This doesn't happen when you ask someone to pretend the words aren't
real. The result is a clear indicator that the subject's visual processing
is being altered in some way - they're no longer reading the words.

Studies have even been performed using FMRI tests </a>,
 and although the results aren't yet
conclusive, they indicate reduced activity in the parts of the brain responsible
for reading - something that isn't normally controllable.
</p>
<p>
This is a clear indication that hypnosis is not only 'real' but could be a
useful tool in understanding how we percieve our world.
