<h1>My hobby</h1>
<h3>Hypnosis</h3>
</header>
<p>
One of my hobbies is a little unusual. I'm a hypnotist. I've been hypnotizing 
people for about 10 years now. In the past, I ran an educational blog and
had a store where you could buy recordings, (<a href="www.ihypnou.com">www.ihypnou.com</a>
 )but it's currently dead due to a broken wordpress install. :( I still have
some videos on youtube and at least one article on Instructables.
</p>
<p>I've always been interested in perception. I'm partially colorblind, so the
question of how the brain processes sensory input has always been on my mind. 
My eyes are biologically different than most people's, but how have I adapted
to that? Am I seeing fewer colors, or different ones? Where do color names come
into play.  Hypnosis provides some
of the deepest insights into just what's happening when you see things. 
</p>
<p>
One of my favorite demonstrations with hypnosis has to do with something called
the Stroop Effect.  It's based on a chart like the one shown below:
</p>

<p>
You time how long it takes someone to list out the colors that the words are 
written in.  Then you compare just how long it takes to do the same thing with
the image below.
</p>

<p>
The second image, where the color names are written in completely different 
colors, takes people substantially longer to complete, due to the brain
wanting to return the color word as the answer. However, if you hypnotize
someone and give them the suggestion that the words in the image are written
in a foreign language that they don't know how to read, the difference in time
disappears.
